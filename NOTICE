This product includes mostly software developed at Antares Gruppen AS (http://www.antares.no)

The project is initially closely tied to the dbUnit project (http://www.dbunit.org), as it is supposed to be a component
running on top of dbUnit and adding capabilities.
The author hopes this project is worthy to commit to the dbUnit project eventually, if so license may be changed to LGPL

The XmlStreamer is a ported version of code found at http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/XML/XmlReaderToWriter.htm

The pom.xml file lists other dependencies that may be of interest if you are into building code yourself.
